DATABASE AND TABLE SET-UP

1. Create Database and Table:
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE llin_analysis;

-- Use the database
USE llin_analysis;

-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE llin_distribution (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    number_distributed INT,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    country VARCHAR(255),
    year INT,
    by_whom VARCHAR(255),
    country_code VARCHAR(3)
);


DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
2. Calculate the Total Number of LLINs Distributed in Each Country:
SELECT country, SUM(number_distributed) AS total_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY country;

> > Find the Average Number of LLINs Distributed per Distribution Event:
SELECT AVG(number_distributed) AS average_llins_per_event
FROM llin_distribution;

> Determine the Earliest and Latest Distribution Dates:
SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_distribution_year, MAX(year) AS latest_distribution_year
FROM llin_distribution;


TRENDS AND PATTERNS
3. Identify the Total Number of LLINs Distributed by Each Organization:
SELECT by_whom, SUM(number_distributed) AS total_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY by_whom;

> Calculate the Total Number of LLINs Distributed in Each Year:
SELECT year, SUM(number_distributed) AS total_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY year;


VOLUME INSIGHTS
4. Find the Locations with the Highest and Lowest Number of LLINs Distributed:
-- Highest
SELECT location, MAX(number_distributed) AS highest_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY highest_llins_distributed DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Lowest
SELECT location, MIN(number_distributed) AS lowest_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY lowest_llins_distributed ASC
LIMIT 1;

> Determine if There's a Significant Difference in the Number of LLINs Distributed by Different Organizations:
SELECT by_whom, SUM(number_distributed) AS total_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY by_whom
ORDER BY total_llins_distributed DESC;


IDENTIFYING EXTREMES
5. Identify Any Outliers or Significant Spikes in the Number of LLINs Distributed in Specific Locations or Periods:
-- Outliers by location
SELECT location, number_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
ORDER BY number_distributed DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Outliers by period
SELECT year, SUM(number_distributed) AS total_llins_distributed
FROM llin_distribution
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_llins_distributed DESC
LIMIT 5;
