LLIN Distribution Analysis
You are a data analyst working for a global health organization. Your task is to analyze the distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) across various locations in multiple countries. The goal is to understand the distribution patterns, identify trends, and gain insights into the effectiveness of different distribution campaigns.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns

> ID: A unique identifier for each distribution record.
> Number distributed: The number of LLINs distributed.
> Location: The specific location where the LLINs were distributed.
> Country: The country where the distribution took place.
> When: The period during which the distribution occurred.
> By_whom: The organization responsible for the distribution.
> Country_code: The ISO code of the country.

Assignment Tasks
1. Database and Table Setup
Create a database named llin_analysis. Create a table named llin_distribution with the appropriate columns based on the dataset provided.

2. Descriptive Statistics
Calculate the total number of LLINs distributed in each country. Find the average number of LLINs distributed per distribution event. Determine the earliest and latest distribution dates in the dataset.

3. Trends and Patterns
Identify the total number of LLINs distributed by each organization. Calculate the total number of LLINs distributed in each year.

4. Volume Insights
Find the locations with the highest and lowest number of LLINs distributed. Determine if there's a significant difference in the number of LLINs distributed by different organizations.

5. Identifying Extremes
Identify any outliers or significant spikes in the number of LLINs distributed in specific locations or periods.
